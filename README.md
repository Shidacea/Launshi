# Launshi

Default project launcher for the Shidacea engine

# How to use

Launshi is a launcher application designed to load Shidacea projects written entirely in mruby to minimize platform-dependent components. 

This project is referenced as a submodule by the Shidacea repository.

Usually, it is the default project loaded into Shidacea in order to bootstrap other projects, but it can technically be used as a standalone project as well, as it is written entirely in mruby.

If it is used as the default launcher, it is recommended to compile it directly into the Shidacea executable.
